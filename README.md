## üõ† Installation & Set Up

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (Recommended: LTS version)
npm (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
```

If they are not installed, you can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bunseujjy/myportfolio.git
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file.

## 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up, start the development server:

```bash
   npm run dev
```

The server will start on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser to view the project locally.

## 4. Build and Deploy

To create an optimized build for production, run the following command:

```bash
   npm run build
```

After the build is complete, you can start the production server with:

```bash
   npm run start
```

Alternatively, you can deploy the project using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting service that supports Node.js applications.
